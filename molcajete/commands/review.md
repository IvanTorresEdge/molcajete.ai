# Code Review

You perform a thorough code review on a set of changes. You analyze correctness, security, performance, style, and test coverage, then output a structured report. You never modify code — this is a read-only review.

**Review scope:** $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Determine Scope

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine what to review:

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Empty or `staged` | Review staged changes: `git diff --cached` |
| Commit range (e.g., `HEAD~3..HEAD`) | Review commits: `git diff {range}` |
| PR number (e.g., `#123` or `123`) | Review PR diff: `gh pr diff {number}` |
| Branch name | Review branch diff: `git diff master...{branch}` |

If `$ARGUMENTS` is ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion to clarify.

Run the appropriate git command to get the diff. Also run `git diff --cached --stat` or equivalent to get a file-level summary.

## Step 2: Classify Changed Files

From the diff stat, classify changed files into groups:

- **go_files**: `.go` files
- **ts_files**: `.ts` and `.tsx` files
- **schema_files**: `.sql`, `.graphql`, and `.graphqls` files
- **other_files**: everything else (configs, docs, etc.)

## Step 3: Launch Parallel Reviewers

Launch 1-3 parallel `general-purpose` sub-agents using the Task tool in a single message, conditional on which file groups are non-empty:

**Go Reviewer** (launch if `go_files` is non-empty, subagent_type: `general-purpose`):
- Prompt: You are reviewing Go code changes. Read these skill files for conventions:
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/go-writing-code/SKILL.md`
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/software-principles/SKILL.md`
  Then read the full content of each changed Go file (provide the file list). Also read `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific conventions.
  Review each file across these dimensions:
  1. **Correctness** — logic errors, nil checks, error handling, race conditions, unreachable code
  2. **Security** — SQL injection, auth/authz issues, secrets in code, input validation, OWASP top 10
  3. **Performance** — N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes, blocking in async contexts
  4. **Style** — CLAUDE.md violations (resolver pattern, naming), skill convention violations, code organization
  5. **Tests** — are changed paths covered? are new functions missing tests?
  Return:
  ```
  GO_REVIEW:
  FINDINGS:
  - Severity: CRITICAL | WARNING | SUGGESTION | NITPICK
    File: {path:line}
    Dimension: {correctness|security|performance|style|tests}
    Issue: {description}
    Fix: {specific suggestion}
  POSITIVE:
  {2-3 good things about the Go changes}
  ```

**TS/React Reviewer** (launch if `ts_files` is non-empty, subagent_type: `general-purpose`):
- Prompt: You are reviewing TypeScript/React code changes. Read these skill files for conventions:
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/typescript-writing-code/SKILL.md`
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/react-writing-code/SKILL.md`
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/software-principles/SKILL.md`
  Then read the full content of each changed TS/TSX file (provide the file list). Also read `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific conventions.
  Review each file across these dimensions:
  1. **Correctness** — type errors, async issues, undefined refs, hook rules, state update order
  2. **Security** — XSS, unescaped user input, auth issues, secrets exposure
  3. **Performance** — unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, large bundles, missing lazy loading
  4. **Style** — CLAUDE.md violations (component architecture, i18n, Biome), naming conventions, code organization
  5. **Tests** — are changed paths covered? are new components/hooks missing tests?
  Return:
  ```
  TS_REVIEW:
  FINDINGS:
  - Severity: CRITICAL | WARNING | SUGGESTION | NITPICK
    File: {path:line}
    Dimension: {correctness|security|performance|style|tests}
    Issue: {description}
    Fix: {specific suggestion}
  POSITIVE:
  {2-3 good things about the TS/React changes}
  ```

**Schema Reviewer** (launch if `schema_files` is non-empty, subagent_type: `general-purpose`):
- Prompt: You are reviewing database and GraphQL schema changes. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions (multi-schema GraphQL pattern, viewer pattern, PostgreSQL rules, migration conventions).
  Then read the full content of each changed schema file (provide the file list).
  Review each file for:
  1. **Migrations** — reversibility, data safety, index creation, column constraints, naming conventions
  2. **GraphQL** — viewer pattern compliance, data exposure between roles (patient/doctor/console), input validation, error codes
  3. **Data safety** — PII handling, encryption requirements, cascade deletes, foreign key integrity
  Return:
  ```
  SCHEMA_REVIEW:
  FINDINGS:
  - Severity: CRITICAL | WARNING | SUGGESTION | NITPICK
    File: {path:line}
    Dimension: {migrations|graphql|data-safety}
    Issue: {description}
    Fix: {specific suggestion}
  POSITIVE:
  {1-2 good things about the schema changes}
  ```

## Step 4: Merge and Report

After all reviewers return:

1. Review `other_files` inline yourself (small configs, docs — quick check for correctness and convention compliance)
2. Merge all findings from the parallel reviewers, sorted by severity
3. Merge all positive observations

Format the final report:

```
## Review Summary

**Scope:** {what was reviewed — staged changes, commit range, PR}
**Files changed:** {count}
**Lines:** +{added} / -{removed}

## Issues

### Critical
{Issues that must be fixed before merging — bugs, security vulnerabilities, data loss risks}

- **[file:line]** {Description of the issue}
  - Why: {Explanation of the impact}
  - Fix: {Specific suggestion}

### Warning
{Issues that should be fixed — performance problems, missing error handling, convention violations}

### Suggestion
{Improvements that would make the code better but aren't blocking}

### Nitpick
{Minor style preferences, optional improvements}

## What Looks Good

{Merged positive observations from all reviewers}

## Verdict

{One of: APPROVE, REQUEST CHANGES, or NEEDS DISCUSSION}
{One sentence summary of the overall assessment}
{Total: X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions, W nitpicks}
```

If no issues are found in a category, omit that section.

## Rules

- Use AskUserQuestion for ALL user interaction. Never ask questions as plain text.
- This is a READ-ONLY review. Never modify files, stage changes, or create commits.
- Read the full file for context, not just the diff hunks.
- Be specific: always include file path and line number for issues.
- Be constructive: provide fix suggestions, not just complaints.
- Do not use the word "comprehensive" in any output.
- Do not flag issues in code that wasn't changed unless the changes interact directly with the issue.
