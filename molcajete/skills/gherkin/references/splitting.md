# Feature File Splitting Procedure

This procedure runs after generation and indexing. It checks whether the target feature file has grown beyond the scenario limit (FR-0KTg-050 through FR-0KTg-053). This applies to both new and existing features.

## Count Scenarios

1. Read the target feature file (the one just created or appended to).
2. Count the total number of `Scenario:` and `Scenario Outline:` blocks.
3. If the count is **15 or fewer**, skip the rest of this procedure — proceed to the Summary Output.

## Promote to Directory

If the count exceeds 15:

1. **Group scenarios by logical concern.** Read all scenario names, tags, and step patterns. Apply these heuristics to form groups:
   - Scenarios sharing a specific tag (e.g., `@login`, `@password-reset`) → same group
   - Scenarios testing the same user flow (happy path + its error/edge cases) → same group
   - Scenarios sharing identical Given/Background setup → likely same group
   - Aim for 5-10 scenarios per group. Avoid single-scenario groups unless the scenario is truly standalone.

2. **Create the feature directory:** `bdd/features/{domain}/{feature-name}/` (same name as the original file, without extension).

3. **Create sub-files:** For each group, create a `.feature` (or `.feature.md`) file inside the new directory:
   - File name: descriptive kebab-case name reflecting the group's concern (e.g., `login.feature`, `password-reset.feature`, `session-management.feature`).
   - Each file must have its own `Feature:` line (use a descriptive sub-feature name), feature-level tags, and description.
   - If scenarios in the group share preconditions, add a `Background:` block to that file.
   - Preserve all scenario tags, steps, and examples exactly as they were in the original file.
   - **Prohibited names:** `part-1.feature`, `scenarios-1-to-7.feature`, `misc.feature`, or any name based on numeric ranges or ordering.

4. **Delete the original file:** Remove the single feature file that was promoted.

5. **Update `bdd/features/INDEX.md`:** Replace the single-file entry for this feature with a directory entry listing each sub-file and its scenarios:
   ```markdown
   ### {Feature Name}
   - **Directory:** `{domain}/{feature-name}/`
   - **Summary:** {1-sentence description}
   - **Files:**
     - `{sub-file-name}.feature` — {group description}
       - {Scenario name} — {brief description}
       - {Scenario name} — {brief description}
     - `{sub-file-name}.feature` — {group description}
       - {Scenario name} — {brief description}
   ```

6. **Update the summary:** Set the "Action" field to "Split into directory" and list the sub-files created.
