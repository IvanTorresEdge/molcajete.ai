# Scaffold Procedure

This procedure ensures the `bdd/` directory structure exists and that INDEX.md files are in sync with the file system. It runs on every invocation before scenario generation.

## 2a. Check for Existing Scaffold

Glob for `bdd/features/INDEX.md`. If it exists, the scaffold is already set up — skip to 2g (Validate Index Files).

## 2b. Create Base Directories

If `bdd/` does not exist, create the full scaffold:

```
bdd/
├── features/
│   ├── INDEX.md
│   └── cross-domain/
├── steps/
│   └── INDEX.md
```

Use Bash to create the directories:
```
mkdir -p bdd/features/cross-domain bdd/steps
```

## 2c. Detect Domains

Determine which domain subdirectories to create under `bdd/features/`. Follow the domain detection priority from SKILL.md — stop at the first source that yields domain names:

1. **User-defined rules:** Glob `bdd/.claude/rules/*.md`. If files exist, read them for explicit domain mappings and folder names. Use those domains.
2. **BDD conventions file:** If `bdd/CLAUDE.md` exists, read it for domain conventions.
3. **Existing domain folders:** Glob `bdd/features/*/`. If domain folders already exist, preserve them. Do not remove or rename existing domains.
4. **Changelog:** Read `prd/changelog.md`. Look for domain-organized sections or recurring categories (e.g., "Authentication", "Billing", "Notifications"). Extract domain names.
5. **PRD specs:** Glob `prd/specs/*/`. Extract folder slugs and group them into logical domains (e.g., `console_authentication` → `authentication`, `bdd_scenario_generator` → `tooling`).
6. **Codebase structure:** Glob top-level directories and `server/` or `src/` subdirectories. Infer domains from module/package names.

If no sources yield domains, create a single `general/` domain folder.

For each detected domain, create `bdd/features/{domain}/` using kebab-case naming. Always ensure `cross-domain/` exists.

## 2d. Detect Language

Determine which programming language to use for step definitions. Follow the language detection rules from SKILL.md — scan existing step files, default to Python if none exist.

## 2e. Detect Format

Determine the feature file format. Follow the format detection rules from SKILL.md — scan for `.feature.md` vs `.feature` files, default to standard Gherkin.

## 2f. Create Scaffold Files

Do NOT create step definition files during scaffold setup — those are created during scenario generation. During scaffold setup, only create:

1. `bdd/features/INDEX.md` (see `templates/index-features.md`)
2. `bdd/steps/INDEX.md` (see `templates/index-steps.md`)
3. `bdd/steps/world.[ext]` (see `templates/world-{language}.md` for the detected language)
4. `bdd/steps/environment.py` — only if Python is the detected language (included in `templates/world-python.md`)

## 2g. Validate Index Files

This section detects drift between INDEX.md entries and actual files on disk. If the scaffold was just created in this invocation (steps 2b–2f ran), skip this section and proceed to Step 3 — newly created indexes are empty and inherently in sync. Otherwise (Step 2a routed here because the scaffold already existed), run the checks below.

**Detect feature index drift:**

1. Glob `bdd/features/**/*.feature` and `bdd/features/**/*.feature.md` to collect all feature files on disk.
2. Read `bdd/features/INDEX.md` and extract every file path from `**File:**` and `**Directory:**` entries. Normalize paths to be relative to `bdd/features/` (e.g., `auth/login.feature`).
3. Compare the two sets:
   - **Stale entries:** Paths in INDEX.md that do not match any file on disk. A directory entry is stale only if the directory itself is missing.
   - **Missing entries:** Feature files on disk that have no corresponding INDEX.md entry (no `**File:**` line pointing to them).

**Detect step index drift:**

1. Glob `bdd/steps/*_steps.*` to collect all step definition files on disk.
2. Read `bdd/steps/INDEX.md` and extract all unique file names from the `Source` column of each table.
3. Compare the two sets:
   - **Stale entries:** Source files referenced in INDEX.md that do not exist on disk.
   - **Missing entries:** Step files on disk that have no entries in INDEX.md.

**Act on results:**

- If **no drift** detected in either index → proceed to Step 3.
- If **drift detected** → report the discrepancies: "Index drift detected. Stale entries: {list}. Missing entries: {list}." Then proceed to 2h (rebuild indexes from file system).

## 2h. Rebuild Indexes from File System

This section runs only when 2g detected drift in either index. It rebuilds **both** INDEX.md files from scratch using actual file contents — rebuilding one without the other could introduce new drift. After rebuilding, report what was fixed and proceed to Step 3.

**Rebuild `bdd/features/INDEX.md`:**

1. Glob `bdd/features/**/*.feature` and `bdd/features/**/*.feature.md` to collect all feature files on disk.
2. Identify promoted feature directories: any directory under `bdd/features/{domain}/` that contains `.feature` or `.feature.md` files (e.g., `bdd/features/auth/login/` containing `happy-path.feature` and `error-handling.feature`).
3. For each feature file, read it and extract:
   - The `Feature:` name (text after the `Feature:` keyword on the first matching line).
   - The feature description (the line(s) immediately following the `Feature:` line, before the first `Background:`, `Scenario:`, or `Scenario Outline:`).
   - All scenario names: lines matching `Scenario:` or `Scenario Outline:` — extract the name portion after the keyword.
4. Determine each feature's domain from its parent directory name relative to `bdd/features/` (e.g., `bdd/features/auth/login.feature` → domain `auth`). Files in promoted directories use the grandparent directory as domain (e.g., `bdd/features/auth/login/happy-path.feature` → domain `auth`).
5. Group features by domain. Within each domain, sort features alphabetically by file name.
6. Write `bdd/features/INDEX.md` from scratch using the template from `templates/index-features.md`:
   - One `## {Domain Name}` heading per domain (title-case the domain name).
   - For single-file features: use the standard entry format with `**File:**`, `**Summary:**`, and `**Scenarios:**` (bulleted list of scenario names with descriptions).
   - For promoted feature directories: use the directory entry format from `references/splitting.md` with `**Directory:**`, `**Summary:**`, and `**Files:**` (bulleted list of sub-files, each with nested scenario bullets).
   - Summarize each feature in one sentence derived from its description. If no description exists, use the feature name.

**Rebuild `bdd/steps/INDEX.md`:**

1. Glob `bdd/steps/*_steps.*` to collect all step definition files on disk.
2. For each step file, read it and extract step definitions using language-aware parsing:
   - **Python:** Find `@given(`, `@when(`, `@then(` decorators — extract the string pattern (e.g., `user {name} is logged in`). Read the docstring below the function for description and parameter info.
   - **Go:** Find `ctx.Step(` calls in `InitializeScenario` methods — extract the regex pattern string. Match each regex to its corresponding step function (named in the second argument). Read the doc comment above that step function for description and parameters.
   - **TypeScript:** Find `Given(`, `When(`, `Then(` calls — extract the string pattern. Read the JSDoc comment above for description and parameters.
3. Determine each step file's category from its filename:
   - `common_steps.*` → Common Steps
   - `api_steps.*` → API Steps
   - `db_steps.*` → Database Steps
   - `{name}_steps.*` → {Name} Steps (domain-specific, title-case the name)
4. Group steps by category. Within each category, sort by pattern alphabetically.
5. Write `bdd/steps/INDEX.md` from scratch using the template from `templates/index-steps.md`:
   - One `## {Category} Steps` heading per category.
   - A table under each heading with columns: Pattern, Description, Parameters, Source.
   - If a step has no extractable description, use the pattern text as the description.

**Report changes:**

After both indexes are rebuilt, report a per-index summary: "Features INDEX rebuilt: {count} stale entries removed, {count} missing entries added. Steps INDEX rebuilt: {count} stale entries removed, {count} missing entries added." Then proceed to Step 3.
