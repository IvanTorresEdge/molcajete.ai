# Features INDEX.md Template

Write this to `bdd/features/INDEX.md`:

```markdown
# BDD Features Index

## {Domain Name}

### {Feature Name}
- **File:** `{domain}/{feature-name}.feature`
- **Summary:** {1-sentence description}
- **Scenarios:**
  - {Scenario name} — {brief description}
  - {Scenario name} — {brief description}
```

Group features by their domain folder. Each feature entry lists the file path, a summary, and all scenario names with brief descriptions. When the scaffold is first created, the INDEX.md will have domain headings but no feature entries yet.
