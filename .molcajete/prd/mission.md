# Molcajete.ai Mission

## Vision

I built Molcajete.ai as a curated plugin marketplace that brings **consistency, quality, and reliability** to AI-assisted development with Claude Code. I'm tired of "AI multiple-personality disorder"—one day you get brilliant results, the next day the same prompt gives you garbage. So I created opinionated, battle-tested workflows that deliver predictable results across all stages of software development—from product planning to deployment.

My vision: Make Claude Code the most reliable and productive AI development tool by providing specialized agents and workflows that just work.

## Problem Statement

I was facing three critical challenges using Claude Code:

1. **Inconsistent AI outputs** - Results varied wildly across sessions, making AI unreliable for production workflows
2. **Lack of specialized expertise** - Generic AI assistants don't provide deep domain knowledge for specific tasks (Go development, Solidity, product planning, etc.)
3. **No reusable workflows** - I kept recreating the same processes and couldn't share best practices across projects

Molcajete.ai solves all three: it provides **consistent, specialized, and reusable** workflows through a curated plugin collection.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

I'm building this primarily for myself, but I know there are others like me:

**Individual Developers (Solo Projects)**
- Building personal or freelance projects
- Need reliable AI assistance without spending time on prompt engineering
- Value consistency and quality over experimentation

**Development Teams (2-10 People)**
- Small to medium teams working on shared codebases
- Require consistent workflows and shared best practices
- Want to standardize development processes without heavy tooling

### User Pain Points

These are the pain points I experience daily:

- **Inconsistent code quality** - AI-generated code varies in quality, style, and adherence to best practices
- **Lack of workflow standardization** - No shared processes or templates; everyone reinvents the wheel
- **Context switching fatigue** - Constantly moving between tools, docs, and Claude disrupts productivity

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Curated Quality Over Quantity
Every plugin is battle-tested and opinionated. I don't include everything—only what works reliably in my real-world development.

### 2. End-to-End Workflow Coverage
I've built complete coverage from product planning (prd) to research (res) to code generation (go, sol) to git workflows. Not just code generation.

### 3. Consistency and Reliability
Structured agents and skills eliminate variability in AI outputs. Same input → same quality output, every time.

### Combined Advantage
Curation + comprehensive workflows + consistency create a defensible moat. This isn't just another prompt library.

## What I Won't Do

- **Support non-Claude AI models** - I'm staying focused on Claude Code ecosystem (no ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- **Build for everyone** - I'm deliberately opinionated; not trying to be all things to all people
- **Compromise quality for quantity** - Better to have 10 excellent plugins than 100 mediocre ones

## Success Definition

**Primary Success Metric:** Personal satisfaction and utility

Molcajete.ai succeeds when it satisfies my own development needs. If it proves useful to others, that's a bonus—but the core measure is whether it solves real workflow problems for me.

**Secondary Indicators (if applicable):**
- Community engagement (GitHub stars, contributions, issues)
- Adoption by other individual developers and small teams
- Quality of community-contributed plugins

## Values

1. **Opinionated and Proud** - I have strong opinions loosely held; I make choices so users don't have to
2. **Battle-Tested Only** - Every workflow must be proven in my real-world use before inclusion
3. **Simplicity First** - Avoid premature complexity; build what's needed, not what might be needed
4. **Creator-First** - I build for my personal needs first; community adoption is secondary
5. **Documentation as Code** - Every plugin must be thoroughly documented and self-explanatory
